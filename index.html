                    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
                    <p>I started my first career when I was 19 years old. I started working for a Correction Facility because I wanted to pursue a Career in Law Enforcement. After about 3 and a half years I applied for a career with the White Pine County Sheriff's Office as my goal was to become a Patrol Deputy. My prior experience allowed for me to be offered a position as a Patrol Deputy instead of starting as a Jail Deputy as most Patrol Deputies do. I was more than happy as that is where I wanted to be. <br><br> I was 23 years old and figured I would be spending the next 30 years helping the community that I loved. I loved almost everything about being a cop and I loved the people I worked with even more. I lived in a very Law Enforcement friendly community and I loved being able to be out with the public promoting community policing. Fast forward a few years and a few kids I found the joy and reward of being a father and husband to be greater than the reward of being a Deputy Sheriff. <br><br> I found myself being affected by the job and the things I saw and dealt with a lot more after having kids and after many months of self finding I chose to pursue a new career as a Full Stack Web Developer. I have family in the Computer Science Career and I see how much joy it brings to them and I've always enjoyed working with, playing on and figuring out how computers work so I figured why not try it! Boy am I glad I did! The time I've spent working with the great instructors and mentors at DevMountain as well as the students I've found myself and my family's spirits grow. I am proud to say I am going to be a Full Stack Web Developer and I will be proud to say that until retirement.</p>

                    <p>Connect 4 is a game I created using JavaScript and HTML. This game is played with two separate people on the same device. This was a fun build as it was one of my first apps that I made and I learned a lot after spending hours coming through multiple bugs written into my code the first time around.</p>

                    <p>This is a small app that I deployed. Its a game of tic-tac-toe that is played by yourself. The game itself was not my creation however I did add a few features to the app including the game accepting your name returning a different winning or losing phrase.</p>
